## Backstory

I liked this extension called [Currently](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/currently/ojhmphdkpgbibohbnpbfiefkgieacjmh) which showed the current time.
It worked fine for seven years and then was "updated" to show a Yahoo search bar instead of showing the time.
Currently was always a bit slow.
I used a dark theme so it would always temporarily flash white when I opened a new tab before it updated with my theme preference.
The recent update made it even slower, totally ugly, added a bunch of network requests, required my current location, and increased the size of the extension to 3MB.

I was upset and pretty sure Currently had become malicious adware, or was on the cusp of it.
So I made this extension to serve the old purpose.
It's small, fast, doesn't flash, and doesn't do anything more than show a clock on a dark background.
That's all I really wanted.
